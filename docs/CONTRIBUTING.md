# Contributing to Workly Client

This project uses git hooks to enforce coding style, formatting, and correctness before changes reach the repository.

## Development Quality Workflow

### Pre-commit Hook (Formatting & Linting)
When you run `git commit`, `lint-staged` will automatically run:
1. **ESLint (`eslint --fix --max-warnings=0`)** on all staged `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, and `.jsx` files.
2. **Prettier (`prettier --write`)** on all staged files (including `.json`, `.md`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.css` files).

Your commit will be blocked if there are unfixable lint errors or warnings.

### Pre-push Hook (Type Checking)
When you run `git push`, a pre-push hook runs the full compiler type-check:
```bash
yarn type-check
```
Your push will be blocked if there are any TypeScript compilation errors.

## Emergency Bypass
If you have a genuine emergency and need to bypass the checks, use the `--no-verify` flag:
* Bypass commit hooks: `git commit -m "..." --no-verify`
* Bypass push hooks: `git push origin branch --no-verify`

*Note: Use this sparingly. Continuous Integration (CI) will still reject files with lint or type errors.*

## Continuous Integration (CI) Check
CI runs the same quality validation on every pull request:
```bash
# Verify type-safety
yarn type-check

# Verify linting
yarn lint
```
